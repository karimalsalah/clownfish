# gitcrawl-254-fresh-plan-ramp

Repo: openclaw/openclaw

Run: [https://github.com/openclaw/clownfish/actions/runs/27665577567](https://github.com/openclaw/clownfish/actions/runs/27665577567)

Workflow conclusion: success

Worker result: planned

Canonical: #90548

## Summary

Read-only plan: keep #90548 as the live canonical issue. Keep #75767 related rather than closing it because it shares the macOS lsof/port-health area but has a distinct SMB-mounted-volume stat timeout/restart-hang reproduction path.

## Fix Execution Actions

| Action | Status | Target | Branch | Reason |

## Apply Actions

| _None_ |  |  |  |  |

## Worker Action Matrix

| Target | Action | Status | Classification | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #90548 | keep_canonical | planned | canonical | Best live canonical for the lsof port-health polling saturation report. |
| #75767 | keep_related | planned | related | Related same subsystem and likely fix family, but not a true duplicate because the reported trigger and user-visible failure mode are meaningfully different. |

## Needs Human

- none
